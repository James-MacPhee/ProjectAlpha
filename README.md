# ProjectAlpha
ProjectAlpha is a (not so) secret project by myself and James MacPhee, a fellow 2nd year student at Dalhousie.  We are attempting to use "ml5.js" which is a machine learning library for the web to track our position through the webcam of our computers and use it to control our application.
We will continue to work on and update this project as time moves forward.
